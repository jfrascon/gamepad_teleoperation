# This is a template for creating a repository file. Replace the placeholders with actual values.
#
# Recommendations:
# - For referencing internal repositories from Eurecat or private code repositories, it is advised to use
#   SSH URLs (e.g., git@<server>:<repository_path>). This method requires:
#     1. Possession of an SSH key pair (private and public keys).
#     2. The public key must be registered in the private repository from which you want to download code.
# - For projects hosted on public servers like GitHub, it is recommended to use HTTPS URLs
#   (e.g., https://<server>/<repository_path>).
